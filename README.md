Parallel B-Trees
================

## Project Description

B-Trees are a self-balancing search tree data structure that features fast and
consistent operations like lookups, deletions and insertions into a dataset.
They are often used in databases and since the growth of the internet the amount
of data that has to be handled have only grown rapidly.

In order to handle the large amount of data I wish to explore the possibility of
using General Purpose Processing Units (GPGPU) to achieve fast parallel
operations using a B-Tree data structure in Futhark.
